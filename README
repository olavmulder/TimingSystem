Timing system, can measure time with socket connection between RPI & arduino
webinterface does show after refreshing current time aka last measured time

Start is implemeted with commandline input from the RPI.
Finish is implemeted with no input from lazer

#TODO next version(s)
1. add code in rpi to get input from gpio
1a. make start also automatic 

2. math user to current time & put in database

3. add screen to RPI, to see time without webinterface
